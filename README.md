# OrchestrAI

## Overview

OrchestrAI is a multi-agent orchestration engine designed to automate digital content pipelines and AI-driven avatar systems.

This project focuses on building scalable infrastructure rather than a single AI persona.

Core goals:

- Modular agent orchestration
- Structured prompt pipelines
- Automated content workflows
- Analytics-driven feedback loops
- B2C experimental identity network
- B2B digital avatar infrastructure

---

## Architecture Vision

The system is composed of specialized agents:

- Strategist Agent
- Scriptwriter Agent
- Media Generation Agent
- Editing Agent
- Publishing Agent
- Analytics Agent

All agents communicate using structured schemas.
